# University of Cincinnati IT3047: Web Server Application Development
## Jeremy L. Shepherd

This project was is my starting point for Lab #1. In order to practice and get more comfortable with the CLI, I worked in VSCODE and generated most of the project through the CLI.

I was provided a starting solution file but wanted to practice more fully so I am coding this in parallel to the provided project. The next branch will be results from the coding assignment.
